- 👋 Hi, I’m @equill
- 👀 I’m interested in Common Lisp and knowledge-management.
    - I also have a strong interest in IT infrastructure management, hence [Syscat](https://github.com/equill/syscat).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
    - how to implement AAA systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GUIs for [Restagraph](https://github.com/equill/restagraph), *especially* for https://github.com/equill/syscat
- 📫 How to reach me ... is TBA. I'll have project-specific addresses soon enough.
